Hallo Everyone
<br></br>
Here I want to share my project that I have worked on with you, I created the theme of this project with the aim of sharing used goods with other people, so in this project there will be features that support goods sharing transactions on this website in the future.

This project uses the Laravel framework version 8, do you know what Laravel is? Laravel is a framework that can make it easier for you when creating a project because it is structured. Laravel uses the PHP programming language as its base so it is easy to understand.

That's a brief overview of this project, hopefully it helps you
